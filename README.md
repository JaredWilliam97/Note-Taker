# 11 Express.js: Note Taker

## Your Task

In this project I created an application called Note Taker that can be used to write and save notes. This application will use an Express.js back end and will save and retrieve note data from a JSON file.

I created a live link to Heroku so the site can be accessed.

This homework will combine many of the skills I've learned so far.

AS A small business owner
I WANT to be able to write and save notes
SO THAT I can organize my thoughts and keep track of tasks I need to complete
